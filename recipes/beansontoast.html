    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sometimes a breakfast is worth taking some time over. Other mornings, you just need something quick and delicious. This recipe can be either depending on the occasion.</p>
    <p>We all know a bean-snob, but the key to this one is getting the heat <em>just right</em>, so those little orange wonders pick up all the subtleties of your mood.</p>
      
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Tin of beans (don't be a snob!)</li>
      <li>Two thick slabs of bread</li>
      <li>Enough butter to paint a wall</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Take a silent, unhurried moment before you open your beans. Sometimes I feel like I'm praying. 
        I don't worry about the words you use, I just try connecting to whatever's out there using my current emotions. Don't feel you can only prepare like this in a good mood: 
        beans can withstand the foulest of tempers. In fact, on the mornings I feel my most pissed-off, this recipe seems to reciprocate with an extraordinary, calming energy.</li>
      <li>Don't worry if you don't feel a connection (or receive an &ldquo;answer&rdquo; if you're praying) - the act of stopping and waiting, even for a short while, is enough.</li>
      <li>Cook your beans, toast your bread and butter it like this is the last meal you'll ever eat.</li>
      <li>Pause regularly while eating to be mindful and grateful. Don't let those bloody bean-snobs get you down.</li>
    </ol>
