Foundations Project: Recipes
## Observations
- Most of the HTML came pretty readily, since I've obviously hung on to some of my old, old knowledge
- Writing recipes sucks, especially as I struggle with them at the best of times. Also, not convinced that I couldn't have just skipped most of the content once I was confident I had the basics of the elements used
- Looking forward to stepping it up with some CSS and especially Javascript
